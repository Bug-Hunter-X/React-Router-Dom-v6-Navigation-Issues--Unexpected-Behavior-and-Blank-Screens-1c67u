# React Router Dom v6 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using React Router v6: unexpected navigation behavior.  Links may fail to work properly, resulting in blank screens or incorrect route rendering.  This is often caused by issues with the <Link> component, incorrect usage of <Routes>, or improper component nesting.

## Problem Description

The provided code shows an example where navigating between routes using `<Link>` components does not work as intended.  This could manifest as links not changing the URL or a blank screen being shown. The error may not be immediately apparent in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the usage of `<Link>`, ensuring it's imported correctly from `react-router-dom`, and double-checking that your routes are properly nested within the `<Routes>` component.  Incorrect nesting can also lead to routing problems.  The solution file provides corrected code showing the proper import statement and route setup.
